# Ideas for improvements or changes

## File type and structure

- we could change the file from a js file to a custom file like a .fuel or .gas file

## Css stuff

- we could include it in the element or in the html file or a separate file

## Compiling

- I think we should compile it with a template html page the user can change

## Root

- a html file as deafult layout, have a 'root' div that the components go in

## Compile client side

## css, js and html all easy to change with in the html config / prop

## use the html or the js to declare where to put the components idk which one

- i think js but html will also work
